Jacobi Method Theory

Given system:

A = D + R

Iteration:

x^(k+1) = D^{-1}(b − Rx^(k))

Convergence condition:

Jacobi converges if:

ρ(D^{-1}R) < 1

where ρ is spectral radius.

In particular, Jacobi converges if:

A is strictly diagonally dominant, or

A is symmetric positive definite (with additional assumptio
